Self Introduction
======
I am currently a graduate student at the National University of Singapore, where I focus on medical image segmentation. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). During my undergraduate years, I developed a strong interest in machine learning and reinforcement learning, which laid a solid foundation for my current research. My academic journey has been driven by a passion for solving real-world problems through intelligent systems, and I am particularly motivated by the potential of machine learning in advancing healthcare technologies.
